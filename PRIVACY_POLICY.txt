# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: December 24, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

- **Gmail Access:** The App requires access to your Gmail account to fetch and process your emails. This access is used solely for extracting details such as deadlines, upcoming events, and other workflow-related information.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Email Processing:** Your emails are processed by both local and cloud-based AI systems to extract relevant information for your workflow.
- **No Unnecessary Data Storage:** We do not store your emails or extracted data longer than necessary to provide the App's features.
- **No Sale of Data:** We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party cloud AI services for email processing. These services are required to comply with industry-standard privacy and security practices.

## Your Choices

You may revoke the App's access to your Gmail account at any time through your Google account settings. Deleting the App will also stop all data processing.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the App or on our website.
